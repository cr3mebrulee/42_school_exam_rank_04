## THE SANDBOX TASK PURPOSE

This task is about creating a sandbox environment to run functions in a controlled way and determining whether the function is "nice" or "bad." The idea is to isolate the function execution so that if it misbehaves (e.g., crashes, times out, or exits with an error), it does not affect the overall system.

### WHAT SANDBOX IS

In the computer field, sandboxing is a security mechanism that isolates running programs, such as untrusted processes or code, to restrict their access permissions. The virtual environment contains some virtual hardware and software resources, such as file systems, networks, and operating systems, to run applications or processes. A sandboxed program can access only the limited number of resources inside the sandbox, without affecting the external application, system, or platform. This prevents the program from permanently changing other programs or data in the computer. In the cybersecurity field, sandboxing isolates malicious files to identify unknown attacks.

Three technologies are involved in sandboxing: virtualization, access control, and anti-evasion.

Different Types of Sandboxing

There are multiple types of sandboxing, depending on the scope and level of isolation:

- Application sandboxing (isolating entire applications from the OS and other apps);
- Process sandboxing (running a single process in a restricted environment);
- Virtualization-based sandboxing	(using a virtual machine to isolate software);
- Malware analysis sandboxing	(running malware in a controlled environment to study its behavior);
- Container sandboxing	(isolating applications using OS-level virtualization).

The assignment of 42's sanbox.c is about process sandboxing. Instead of isolating an entire application, we are isolating a single function (process) inside a controlled environment.

What our sandbox does:

- Runs an unknown function (f()) inside a separate process.
- Monitors if the function crashes, times out, or exits incorrectly.
- Prevents bad functions from affecting the main program.
- Ensures that no zombie processes remain after execution.

This is similar to application sandboxing, but at a smaller scale (process level).

### RESRTRICTED ENVIRONMENT IN SANDOX

Restricted environment means limiting what a process (or function) can do to prevent it from causing harm to the system. This includes restricting its access to system resources, execution time, and interactions with other processes.

A restricted environment imposes rules and limitations on a process. These restrictions prevent the process from:
‚úÖ Crashing the system (e.g., through segmentation faults).
‚úÖ Accessing unauthorized files or memory.
‚úÖ Making dangerous system calls (e.g., deleting files, modifying kernel memory).
‚úÖ Running indefinitely (enforcing a timeout).
‚úÖ Becoming a zombie process (proper cleanup after execution).

### HOW IS A PROCESS RESTRICTED

The function int sandbox() will isolate process and run the untrusted function inside a separate process (child) so it cannot affect the main program. Main program will monitor the run time of the untrusted function and kill the process if it runs too long. Main program will detect crashes if they happen and handle signals (e.g., segmentation faults, illegal instructions). Finally, main program will monitore the exit status of the untrusted function and prevent zombie processes.

## PLAN TO IMPEMENT A 42'S SANDBOX

üîπ Step 1: Process Isolation
    The function f() is executed in a child process (fork()), so if it crashes, it doesn‚Äôt affect the parent.

üîπ Step 2: Timeout Mechanism
    If the function runs for too long, alarm(timeout) ensures it is killed after timeout seconds.

üîπ Step 3: Signal Handling (Catching Crashes)
    If f() causes a segfault (SIGSEGV), abort (SIGABRT), or any other signal, your program will detect it using sigaction().

üîπ Step 4: Monitoring Exit Status
    waitpid() helps determine why the function terminated:
        Exited normally? (Nice function ‚úÖ)
        Exited with an error code? (Bad function ‚ùå)
        Crashed due to a signal? (Bad function ‚ùå)

üîπ Step 5: Preventing Zombie Processes
    Ensures that no orphaned child processes remain by correctly using waitpid().
